==============================

# Implementation of graph neural networks

This is the implementation of different research papers on Graph Neural Networks. The papers include spatio-temporal graph for motion prediction and action recognition. 

## Spatio-temporal graphs

- Structural RNN 
- ST-GCN
- Neural Relational Inference

## Installation

Install the dependencies

```sh
conda install 
```
